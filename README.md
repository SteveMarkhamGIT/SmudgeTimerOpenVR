Download the zip.
Create a directory, such as C:\games\SmudgeTimer
Paste the contents of the zip file into this directory.
Optionally, right click on SmudgeTimerOpenVR.exe and create a shortcut

To run, first SteamVR must be running.  If you invoke Phasmophobia from directly from Oculus or Meta, steamVR will be running in the background when the game starts.
Then, run SmudgeTimerOpenVR.exe or its shortcut (either directly from the pc, or using virtual desktop while in VR)
You should now have a watch appear on your left wrist.
To start/stop the timer, point the tips of your controllers at eachother and tap together.

You can use the console window to change things like the footstep speed by entering commands ("gs=150" to change ghost speed to 150%)
The smudge timer will close when SteamVR exits or when the console window is closed.
